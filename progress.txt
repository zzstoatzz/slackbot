# session 1
**Session Reflection**

Original Intent:
- Create a streamlined, single-container Slack bot library
- Port core functionality from existing implementation
- Make it easy to install via PyPI

Progress:
- Basic project structure with minimal files ✅
- Core settings management with environment variables ✅
- Basic Slack event handling with verification ✅
- Development environment with live reload ✅

Actions:

Short-term:
- Add database layer for message history (SQLite)
- Implement basic agent system using pydantic-ai
- Add basic vector store integration (Chroma)

Medium-term:
- Add tool system for agent capabilities
- Create container build process
- Add proper test coverage
- Document setup process for new users

Long-term:
- Publish to PyPI with clear documentation
- Add support for alternative vector stores
- Create example deployments for common platforms
- Build plugin system for custom tools

Current stack:
```python
dependencies = [
    "pydantic-ai[openai]@git+https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai.git@main",
    "prefect",  # For workflow management
    "raggy[chroma]",  # For vector store
]
```

# session 2
**Session Reflection**

Progress:
- Implemented basic PydanticAI agent with in-memory message history ✅
- Added proper backgrounding of message processing ✅
- Fixed thread-based message history to maintain context ✅
- Added comprehensive logging across API and background tasks ✅

Key Learnings:
1. PydanticAI's message history system works well for maintaining conversation context
2. Backgrounding with asyncio.ensure_future() keeps Slack response times fast
3. Prefect flows provide good structure for background processing
4. In-memory message history is working as a first step

Next Steps:
- Add persistent storage for message history
- Implement system prompt customization
- Add basic tools for the agent
- Set up proper error reporting and monitoring

Current Implementation:
- FastAPI for Slack event handling
- PydanticAI for agent and message management
- Prefect for background task processing
- Rich logging across all components

Challenges Addressed:
- Slack's 3-second response requirement
- Thread-based conversation memory
- Background processing of long-running tasks
